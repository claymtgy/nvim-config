# nvim-config
My personal configuration for Neovim.

## Installation:
(When I get one figured out) Execute installation.sh to move the configuration files into .config/nvim

This is now a Lua config. Currently using Lazy.nvim
Ensure you have ripgrep installed


From there, start Neovim, enter "Normal Mode" with the escape key, and type ":PlugInstall" to install all the plugins

## Keys:
```<leader>``` is configured to ","

```<leader> ff``` will run "find files" using Telescope

```<leader> fg``` will search contents of files
