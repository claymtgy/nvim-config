# nvim-config
My personal configuration for Neovim.

## Installation:
Execute installation.sh to move the configuration files into .config/nvim

Ensure you have vim-plug installed (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
Ensure you have ripgrep installed


From there, start Neovim, enter "Normal Mode" with the escape key, and type ":PlugInstall" to install all the plugins

## Keys:
<leader> is configured by default to ","
<leader> ff will run "find files" using Telescope
<leader> fg will search contents of files
